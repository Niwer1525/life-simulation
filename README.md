# Life Simulation
I wanted to create something in Python, so a friend of mine had this idea and I brought it to life.

It's an ultra-simple project reminiscent of "life-simulation." I've read a lot of things about Python, and I did not use pygame for some personal reasons...

## Features
Selectable entities, <br>
Pauseable simulation, <br>
A pretty simple but satisfying UI with information, <br>
Many entities with:
  - Hunger
  - Health
  - Age

Note: These entities are able to reproduce under certain conditions. They will create a child with a blended color from their parents.
